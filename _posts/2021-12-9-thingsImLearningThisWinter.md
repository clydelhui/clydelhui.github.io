title: Things I'm Learning This Winter
---

My first semester in university was really wonderful. Though it was mildly stressful at times, it was great being back in school and learning new things. Perhaps I might write a bit about how things went during the semester sometime soon.

While winter break might be short, I have quite a few things lined up for the remainder of winter.
I might not be able to complete everything that I set out to learn but hopefully I'll at least come out of winter knowing more than I did before I started winter.

Here are a couple of things that I'm planning to learn:
	
- Vim
- Git/Github
- [Qiskit/Quantum Computing](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFEBzvs-VvrXTMy5Y2IqmSaUjfnhvBHR)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Ruby on Rails](https://youtu.be/fmyvWz5TUWg)
- Maybe some Java

Looks kinda crazy eh.

## The Plan.

While this might seem like an absurd amount of stuff to learn in what is essentially a month long holiday, I do have some strategies on get on with it.

### Vim, Git & Github

Well, these pieces of software are used to work with code. So I simply have to use them alongside whatever language I am currently learning.

This whole blog is hosted on Github. I upload new posts/configurations using Git Bash and I edit files with vim. Hence, what you're reading now is practice for me! I'm looking to using vim fully as my main text editor sometime in the future so we'll see how good I get over time.

## Qiskit/Quantum Computing

Physics is one of my main interests and I've been wanting to learn quantum computing seriously for quite some time. I first got exposed to Quantum Computing quite a whiles back during QCamp: A camp organised by NUS' Centre for Quantum Technologies. During the camp, we learnt quite a bit about how quantum computing works, along with other technologies such as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and superconductors. I didn't really manage to properly learn what was going on at that point of time largely due to my lack of mathematical maturity. This time, I hope to learn about quantum algorithms and how to write my own quantum circuits. Hopefully I can get an internship related to Quantum computing sometime in the future.

## Python

While I've picked up several programming languages in the past (Java, C++, visual Basic etc.) I can't say that I have a language that I have really stuck with. In fact, I probably can't write a decent program in any of those programming languages right now.
