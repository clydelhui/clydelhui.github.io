Hi there! I am Clyde Lhui, an undergraduate Computer Science student from the National University of Singapore.

I'm currently also taking a second major in Physics.

I'm interested in finding the different ways that Physics, Math and Computer Science can interact with each other. I hope to learn more about areas such as Quantum Computing, Artificial Intelligence and Computer Simulations in the future. 

This site is relatively empty for now but I hope to populate it with more of my thoughts, projects and experiences in the future.

Thanks for takin the time to read this! I'll be back soon!
